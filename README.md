# Frontend Mentor - Newsletter sign-up form with success message solution

This is my solution to the [Newsletter sign-up form with success message challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/newsletter-signup-form-with-success-message-3FC1AZbNrv).

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Musings

This project was not too difficult since I had practiced client side form validation before. The only place where I had a doubt, was whether to create a second html file for the success message, or to have it in the same html file as the form.

I ended up deciding to use a Modal Dialog and have it in the same html file as the form
